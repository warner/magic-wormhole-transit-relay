    I manage pairs of simultaneous connections to a secondary TCP port,
    both forwarded to the other. Clients must begin each connection with
    "please relay TOKEN for SIDE\n" (or a legacy form without the "for
    SIDE"). Two connections match if they use the same TOKEN and have
    different SIDEs (the redundant connections are dropped when a match is
    made). Legacy connections match any with the same TOKEN, ignoring SIDE
    (so two legacy connections will match each other).

    I will send "ok\n" when the matching connection is established, or
    disconnect if no matching connection is made within MAX_WAIT_TIME
    seconds. I will disconnect if you send data before the "ok\n". All data
    you get after the "ok\n" will be from the other side. You will not
    receive "ok\n" until the other side has also connected and submitted a
    matching token (and differing SIDE).

    In addition, the connections will be dropped after MAXLENGTH bytes have
    been sent by either side, or MAXTIME seconds have elapsed after the
    matching connections were established. A future API will reveal these
    limits to clients instead of causing mysterious spontaneous failures.

    These relay connections are not half-closeable (unlike full TCP
    connections, applications will not receive any data after half-closing
    their outgoing side). Applications must negotiate shutdown with their
    peer and not close the connection until all data has finished
    transferring in both directions. Applications which only need to send
    data in one direction can use close() as usual.
